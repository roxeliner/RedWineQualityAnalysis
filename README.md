# Analysis and Prediction of Red Wine Quality

## Overview
This project delves into the Red Wine Quality dataset, applying statistical analysis and machine learning to predict wine quality and alcohol content. Utilizing a combination of EDA, statistical inference, and linear regression models, this study aims to uncover the factors that influence red wine quality and how these can be modeled to predict wine attributes.

## Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and relationships within the dataset.
- Apply statistical inference to explore correlations and test hypotheses regarding wine quality factors.
- Develop linear regression models to predict wine quality and alcohol content, assessing their performance and interpretability.

## Dataset
The Red Wine Quality dataset comprises 11 physicochemical properties and quality ratings of red wines. [Download the data here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).

## Analysis Highlights
- Correlation analysis revealed moderate relationships between several physicochemical properties.
- Regression models indicated that certain variables have more influence on wine quality and alcohol content than others.
- The model predicting wine quality showed a moderate fit, while the alcohol content model provided stronger predictive power.

## Key Findings
- Certain physicochemical properties are moderate predictors of wine quality; however, the complex nature of wine preferences may require more nuanced models.
- The linear regression model predicting alcohol content outperformed the model predicting wine quality, suggesting more consistent relationships in the former.

## Future Directions
- Further explore variable relationships and alternative modeling techniques to enhance predictive accuracy.
- Consider non-linear models or machine learning techniques that might capture the complexity of wine quality better.
- Implement model improvements and variable selection techniques to refine predictions and insights.
